msgid "The primary symptom of this issue is attempts to download new robot code hang at the \"Waiting for the target (Target) to respond\" step as shown above. Note that there are other possible causes of this symptom (such as switching from a C++\\Java program to LabVIEW program) but the steps described here should resolve most or all of them."

msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/labview/resources/waiting-for-target-to-respond.rst:22
msgid "One common source of this issue is unconstrained loops in your LabVIEW code. An unconstrained loop is a loop which does not contain any delay element (such as the one on the left). If you are unsure where to begin looking, Disabled.VI, Periodic Tasks.VI and Vision Processing.VI are the common locations for this type of loop. To fix the issue with the code, add a delay element such as the Wait (ms) VI from the Timing palette, found in the right loop."
