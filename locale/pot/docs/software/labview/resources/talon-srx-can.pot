msgid "The Talon SRX motor controller is a CAN-enabled \"smart motor controller\" from Cross The Road Electronics/VEX Robotics. The Talon SRX can be controlled over the CAN bus or PWM interface. When using the CAN bus control, this device can take inputs from limit switches and potentiometers, encoders, or similar sensors in order to perform advanced control such as limiting or PID(F) closed loop control on the device."
