msgid "The ``MecanumDriveKinematics`` class accepts four constructor arguments, with each argument being the location of a wheel relative to the robot center (as a ``Translation2d``). The order for the arguments is front left, front right, back left, and back right. The locations for the wheels must be relative to the center of the robot. Positive x values represent moving toward the front of the robot whereas positive y values represent moving toward the left of the robot."

msgid "The ``toWheelSpeeds(ChassisSpeeds speeds)`` (Java) / ``ToWheelSpeeds(ChassisSpeeds speeds)`` (C++) method should be used to convert a ``ChassisSpeeds`` object to a ``MecanumDriveWheelSpeeds`` object. This is useful in situations where you have to convert a forward velocity, sideways velocity, and an angular velocity into individual wheel speeds."

msgid "Sometimes, rotating around one specific corner might be desirable for certain evasive maneuvers. This type of behavior is also supported by the WPILib classes. The same ``ToWheelSpeeds()`` method accepts a second parameter for the center of rotation (as a ``Translation2d``). Just like the wheel locations, the ``Translation2d`` representing the center of rotation should be relative to the robot center."

msgid "Because all robots are a rigid frame, the provided ``vx`` and ``vy`` velocities from the ``ChassisSpeeds`` object will still apply for the entirety of the robot. However, the ``omega`` from the ``ChassisSpeeds`` object will be measured from the center of rotation."

msgid "For example, one can set the center of rotation on a certain wheel and if the provided ``ChassisSpeeds`` object has a ``vx`` and ``vy`` of zero and a non-zero ``omega``, the robot will appear to rotate around that particular wheel."
