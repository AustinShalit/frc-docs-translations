msgid "The ``DifferentialDriveKinematics`` class is a useful tool that converts between a ``ChassisSpeeds`` object and a ``DifferentialDriveWheelSpeeds`` object, which contains velocities for the left and right sides of a differential drive robot."

msgid "The ``DifferentialDriveKinematics`` object accepts one constructor argument, which is the track width of the robot. This represents the distance between the two sets of wheels on a differential drive."

msgid "The ``toWheelSpeeds(ChassisSpeeds speeds)`` (Java) / ``ToWheelSpeeds(ChassisSpeeds speeds)`` (C++) method should be used to convert a ``ChassisSpeeds`` object to a ``DifferentialDriveWheelSpeeds`` object. This is useful in situations where you have to convert a linear velocity (``vx``) and an angular velocity (``omega``) to left and right wheel velocities."

The ``toChassisSpeeds(DifferentialDriveWheelSpeeds speeds)`` (Java) / ``ToChassisSpeeds(DifferentialDriveWheelSpeeds speeds)`` (C++) method should be used to achieve this."
