msgid "A user can use the mecanum drive kinematics classes in order to perform :ref:`odometry <docs/software/kinematics-and-odometry/intro-and-chassis-speeds:What is odometry?>`. WPILib contains a ``MecanumDriveOdometry`` class that can be used to track the position of a mecanum drive robot on the field."

msgid "Because this method only uses encoders and a gyro, the estimate of the robot's position on the field will drift over time, especially as your robot comes into contact with other robots during gameplay. However, odometry is usually very accurate during the autonomous period."

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/kinematics-and-odometry/mecanum-drive-odometry.rst:9
msgid "The ``MecanumDriveOdometry`` class requires two mandatory arguments and one optional argument. The mandatory arguments are the kinematics object that represents your mecanum drive (in the form of a ``MecanumDriveKinematics`` class) and the angle reported by your gyroscope (as a Rotation2d). The third optional argument is the starting pose of your robot on the field (as a ``Pose2d``). By default, the robot will start at ``x = 0, y = 0, theta = 0``."

msgid "0 degrees / radians represents the robot angle when the robot is facing directly toward your opponent's alliance station. As your robot turns to the left, your gyroscope angle should increase. By default, WPILib gyros exhibit the opposite behavior, so you should negate the gyro angle."

msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/kinematics-and-odometry/mecanum-drive-odometry.rst:56
msgid "The ``update`` method of the odometry class updates the robot position on the field. The update method takes in the gyro angle of the robot, along with a ``MecanumDriveWheelSpeeds`` object representing the speed of each of the 4 wheels on the robot. This ``update`` method must be called periodically, preferably in the ``periodic()`` method of a :ref:`Subsystem <docs/software/commandbased/subsystems:Subsystems>`. The ``update`` method returns the new updated pose of the robot."

msgid "The ``MecanumDriveWheelSpeeds`` class in Java must be constructed with each wheel speed in meters per second. In C++, the units library must be used to represent your wheel speeds."
