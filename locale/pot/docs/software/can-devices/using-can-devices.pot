msgid "CAN connections are daisy-chained from device to device, which often results in much shorter wire runs than having to wire each device to the RIO itself."

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/can-devices/using-can-devices.rst:8
msgid "Much more data can be sent over a CAN connection than over a PWM connection - thus, CAN motor controllers are capable of a much more expansive feature-set than are PWM motor controllers."

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/can-devices/using-can-devices.rst:10
msgid "CAN is bi-directional, so CAN motor controllers can send data back to the RIO, again facilitating a more expansive feature-set than can be offered by PWM Controllers."
