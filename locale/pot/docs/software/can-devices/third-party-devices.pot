msgid "A number of FRC vendors offer their own CAN peripherals.  As CAN devices offer expansive feature-sets, vendor CAN devices require similarly expansive code libraries to operate.  As a result, these libraries are not maintained as an official part of WPILib, but are instead maintained by the vendors themselves.  For a guide to installing third-party libraries, see :ref:`3rd Party Libraries <docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries:3rd Party Libraries>`"
