msgid "If you have specified your units correctly, your feedforward gains will likely be within an order of magnitude of the ones reported here (a possible exception exists for ``kA``, which may be vanishingly small if your robot is light).  If they are not, it is possible you specified one of your drive parameters incorrectly when generating your robot project.  A good test for this is to calculate the \"theoretical\" value of ``kV``, which is 12 volts divided by the theoretical free speed of your drivetrain (which is, in turn, the free speed of the motor times the wheel circumference divided by the gear reduction).  This value should agree very closely with the ``kV`` measured by the tool - if it does not, you have likely made an error somewhere."
