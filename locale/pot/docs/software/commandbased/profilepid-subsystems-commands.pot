msgid "Unlike the earlier version of ``PIDController``, the 2020 ``ProfiledPIDController`` class runs *synchronously*, and is not handled in its own thread.  Accordingly, changing its ``period`` parameter will *not* change the actual frequency at which it runs in any of these wrapper classes.  Users should never modify the ``period`` parameter unless they are certain of what they are doing."

msgid "A common FRC controls solution is to pair a trapezoidal motion profile for setpoint generation with a PID controller for setpoint tracking.  To facilitate this, WPILib includes its own :ref:`ProfiledPIDController <docs/software/advanced-controls/controllers/profiled-pidcontroller:Combining Motion Profiling and PID Control with ProfiledPIDController>` class.  To further aid teams in integrating this functionality into their robots, the command-based framework contains two convenience wrappers for the ``ProfiledPIDController`` class: ``ProfiledPIDSubsystem``, which integrates the controller into a subsystem, and ``ProfiledPIDCommand``, which integrates the controller into a command."
