Each iteration (ordinarily once per 20ms), the scheduler polls all registered buttons, schedules commands for execution accordingly, runs the command bodies of all scheduled commands, and ends those commands that have finished or are interrupted."

msgid "The ``CommandScheduler`` is a *singleton*, meaning that it is a globally-accessible class with only one instance.  Accordingly, in order to access the scheduler, users must call the ``CommandScheduler.getInstance()`` command."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/commandbased/command-scheduler.rst:13
msgid "For the most part, users do not have to call scheduler methods directly - almost all important scheduler methods have convenience wrappers elsewhere (e.g. in the ``Command`` and ``Subsystem`` interfaces)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/commandbased/command-scheduler.rst:15
msgid "However, there is one exception: users *must* call ``CommandScheduler.getInstance().run()`` from the ``robotPeriodic()`` method of their ``Robot`` class.  If this is not done, the scheduler will never run, and the command framework will not work.  The provided command-based project template has this call already included."

This method takes a command (and, optionally, a specification as to whether that command is interruptible), and attempts to add it to list of currently-running commands, pending whether it is already running or whether its requirements are available.  If it is added, its ``initialize()`` method is called."

msgid "Thirdly, the scheduler calls the ``execute()`` method of each currently-scheduled command, and then checks whether the command has finished by calling the ``isFinished()`` method.  If the command has finished, the ``end()`` method is also called, and the command is de-scheduled and its required subsystems are freed."
