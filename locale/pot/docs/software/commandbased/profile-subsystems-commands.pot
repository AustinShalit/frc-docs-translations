msgid "To further help teams integrate motion profiling into their command-based robot projects, WPILib includes two convenience wrappers for the ``TrapezoidProfile`` class: ``TrapezoidProfileSubsystem``, which automatically generates and executes motion profiles in its ``periodic()`` method, and the ``TrapezoidProfileCommand``, which executes a single user-provided ``TrapezoidProfile``."
