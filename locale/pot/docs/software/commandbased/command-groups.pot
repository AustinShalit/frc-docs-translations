msgid "Individual commands are capable of accomplishing a large variety of robot tasks, but the simple three-state format can quickly become cumbersome when more advanced functionality requiring extended sequences of robot tasks or coordination of multiple robot subsystems is required. In order to accomplish this, users are encouraged to use the powerful command group functionality included in the command-based library."

msgid "As the name suggests, command groups are combinations of multiple commands. The act of combining multiple objects (such as commands) into a bigger object is known as `composition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition>`__. Command groups *compose* multiple commands into a *composite* command. This allows code to be kept much cleaner and simpler, as the individual *component* commands may be written independently of the code that combines them, greatly reducing the amount of complexity at any given step of the process."

msgid "Most importantly, however, command groups *are themselves commands* - they implement the ``Command`` interface. This allows command groups to be `recursively composed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition#Recursive_composition>`__ - that is, a command group may contain *other command groups* as components."

msgid "In the C++ command-based library, command groups *own* their component commands.  This means that commands passed to command groups will be either moved or copied depending on whether they are rvalues or lvalues (`rvalue/lvalue explanation <http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html>`__).  Due to certain technical concerns, command groups themselves are not copyable, and so recursive composition *must* use move semantics."

msgid "The command-based library supports four basic types of command groups: ``SequentialCommandGroup``, ``ParallelCommandGroup``, ``ParallelRaceGroup``, and ``ParallelDeadlineGroup``. Each of these command groups combines multiple commands into a composite command - however, they do so in different ways:"

The sequential group finishes after the last command in the sequence finishes. It is therefore usually important to ensure that each command in the sequence does actually finish (if a given command does not finish, the next command will never start!)."

However, users are not required to specify requirements manually for command groups - requirements are automatically inferred from the commands included. As a rule, *command groups include the union of all of the subsystems required by their component commands.* Thus, the ``ComplexAuto`` shown previously will require both the drive subsystem and the hatch subsystem of the robot."

msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/commandbased/command-groups.rst:135
msgid "Since command group components are run through their encapsulating command groups, errors could occur if those same command instances were independently scheduled at the same time as the group - the command would be being run from multiple places at once, and thus could end up with inconsistent internal state, causing unexpected and hard-to-diagnose behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/commandbased/command-groups.rst:137
msgid "For this reason, command instances that have been added to a command group cannot be independently scheduled or added to a second command group. Attempting to do so will throw an exception and crash the user program."
