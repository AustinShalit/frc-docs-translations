Usually, this class is used to represent the movement of a drivetrain, where the x component is the forward distance driven, the y component is the distance driven to the side (left positive), and the :math:`\\theta` component is the change in heading. The underlying math behind finding the pose exponential (new pose after moving the pose forward along the curvature of the twist) can be found `here <https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf>`_ in chapter 10."
