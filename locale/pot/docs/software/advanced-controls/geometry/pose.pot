This class has an x and y component, representing the point :math:`(x, y)` or the vector :math:`\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}` on a 2-dimensional coordinate system."

msgid "``Translation2d`` uses the C++ Units library. If you're planning on using other WPILib classes that use ``Translation2d`` in Java, such as the trajectory generator, make sure to use meters."

This class has an angle component, which represents the robot's rotation relative to an axis on a 2-dimensional coordinate system. Positive rotations are counterclockwise."

msgid "``Rotation2d`` uses the C++ Units library. The contructor in Java accepts either the angle in radians, or the sine and cosine of the angle, but the ``fromDegrees`` method will construct a ``Rotation2d`` object from degrees."

msgid "Pose is a combination of both translation and rotation and is represented by the ``Pose2d`` class (`Java <https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/geometry/Pose2d.html>`__, `C++ <https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/cpp/classfrc_1_1Pose2d.html>`__). It can be used to describe the pose of your robot in the field coordinate system, or the pose of objects, such as vision targets, relative to your robot in the robot coordinate system. ``Pose2d`` can also represent the vector :math:`\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ \\theta\\end{bmatrix}`."
