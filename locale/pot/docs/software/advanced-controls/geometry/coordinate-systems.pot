msgid "The field coordinate system (or global coordinate system) is an absolute coordinate system where a point on the field is designated as the origin. Positive :math:`\\theta` (theta) is in the counter-clockwise direction, and the positive x-axis points away from your alliance's driver station wall, and the positive y-axis is perpendicular and to the left of the positive x-axis."
