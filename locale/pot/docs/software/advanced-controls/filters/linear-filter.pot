msgid "The first (and most commonly-employed) sort of filter that WPILib supports is a *linear filter* - or, more specifically, a linear time-invariant (LTI) filter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/linear-filter.rst:6
msgid "An LTI filter is, put simply, a weighted moving average - the value of the output stream at any given time is a localized, weighted average of the inputs near that time.  The difference between different types of LTI filters is thus reducible to the difference in the choice of the weighting function (also known as a \"window function\" or an \"impulse response\") used.  Mathematically, this kind of moving average is known as a `convolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution>`__."

msgid "There are two broad \"sorts\" of impulse responses: infinite impulse responses (IIR), and finite impulse responses (FIR)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/linear-filter.rst:10
msgid "Infinite impulse responses have infinite \"support\" - that is, they are nonzero over an infinitely-large region.  This means, broadly, that they also have infinite \"memory\" - once a value appears in the input stream, it will influence *all subsequent outputs, forever*.  This is typically undesirable from a strict signal-processing perspective, however filters with infinite impulse responses tend to be very easy to compute as they can be expressed by simple recursion relations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/linear-filter.rst:12
msgid "Finite impulse responses have finite \"support\" - that is, they are nonzero on a bounded region.  The \"archetypical\" FIR filter is a flat moving average - that is, simply setting the output equal to the average of the past n inputs.  FIR filters tend to have more-desirable properties than IIR filters, but are more costly to compute."

msgid "The ``singlePoleIIR()`` factory method creates a single-pole infinite impulse response filter (also known as `exponential smoothing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing>`__, on account of having an exponential impulse response).  This is the \"go-to,\" \"first-try\" low-pass filter in most applications; it is computationally trivial and works in most cases."

msgid "The \"time constant\" parameter determines the \"characteristic timescale\" of the filter's impulse response; the filter will cancel out any signal dynamics that occur on timescales significantly shorter than this.  Relatedly, it is also the approximate timescale of the introduced :ref:`phase lag <docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/introduction:Phase Lag>`.  The reciprocal of this timescale, multiplied by 2 pi, is the \"cutoff frequency\" of the filter."

msgid "The ``movingAverage`` factory method creates a simple flat moving average filter.  This is the simplest possible low-pass FIR filter, and is useful in many of the same contexts as the single-pole IIR filter.  It is somewhat more costly to compute, but generally behaves in a somewhat nicer manner."

msgid "The \"taps\" parameter is the number of samples that will be included in the flat moving average.  This behaves similarly to the \"time constant\" above - the effective time constant is the number of taps times the period at which ``calculate()`` is called."
