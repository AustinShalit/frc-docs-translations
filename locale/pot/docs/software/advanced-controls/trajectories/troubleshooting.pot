msgid "Poor trajectory tracking performance can be difficult to troubleshoot. Although the trajectory generator and follower are intended to be easy-to-use and performant out of the box, there are situations where your robot doesn't quite end up where it should. The trajectory generator and followers have many knobs to tune and many moving parts, so it can be difficult to know where to start, especially because it is difficult to locate the source of trajectory problems from the robot's general behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/trajectories/troubleshooting.rst:51
msgid "Because it can be so hard to locate the layer of the trajectory generator and followers that is misbehaving, a systematic, layer-by-layer approach is recommended for general poor tracking performance (e.g. the robot is off by few feet or more than twenty degrees). The below steps are listed in the order that you should do them in; it is important to follow this order so that you can isolate the effects of different steps from each other."

If X is off by more than 5 centimeters in the first test then you should check that you measured your wheel diameter correctly, and that your wheels are not worn down. If the second test is off by more than 5 centimeters in either X or Y then your track width (distance from the center of the left wheel to the center of the right wheel) may be incorrect; if you're sure that you measured the track width correctly with a tape measure then your robot's wheels may be slipping in a way that is not accounted for by track width--if this is the case then you should :ref:`run the track width characterization <docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-characterization/characterization-routine:Running Tests>` and use that track width instead of the one from your tape measure."
