msgid "The ``TrapezoidProfile`` class, used on its own, is most useful when composed with a custom controller (such as a \"smart\" motor controller with a built-in PID functionality).  To integrate it with a WPILib ``PIDController``, see :doc:`profiled-pidcontroller`."

msgid "While feedforward and feedback control offer convenient ways to achieve a given setpoint, we are often still faced with the problem of generating setpoints for our mechanisms.  While the naive approach of immediately commanding a mechanism to its desired state may work, it is often suboptimal.  To improve the handling of our mechanisms, we often wish to command mechanisms to a *sequence* of setpoints that smoothly interpolate between its current state, and its desired goal state."

msgid "In order to create a trapezoidal motion profile, we must first impose some constraints on the desired motion.
