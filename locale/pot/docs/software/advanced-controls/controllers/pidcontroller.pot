msgid "It is sometimes desirable to clear the internal state (most importantly, the integral accumulator) of a ``PIDController``, as it may be no longer valid (e.g. when the ``PIDController`` has been disabled and then re-enabled).  This can be accomplished by calling the ``reset()`` method."

msgid "Integrators introduce instability and hysteresis into feedback loop systems.  It is strongly recommended that teams avoid using integral gain unless absolutely no other solution will do - very often, problems that can be solved with an integrator can be better solved through use of a more-accurate :ref:`feedforward <docs/software/advanced-controls/controllers/feedforward:Feedforward Control in WPILib>`."

msgid "Some process variables (such as the angle of a turret) are measured on a circular scale, rather than a linear one - that is, each \"end\" of the process variable range corresponds to the same point in reality (e.g. 360 degrees and 0 degrees).  In such a configuration, there are two possible values for any given error, corresponding to which way around the circle the error is measured.  It is usually best to use the smaller of these errrors."
