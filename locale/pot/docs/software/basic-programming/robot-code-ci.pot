msgid "An important aspect of working in a team environment is being able to test code that is pushed to a central repository such as GitHub. For example, a project manager or lead developer might want to run a set of unit tests before merging a pull request or might want to ensure that all code on the master branch of a repository is in working order."

msgid "`GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`_ is a service that allows for teams and individuals to build and run unit tests on code on various branches and on pull requests. These types of services are more commonly known as \"Continuous Integration\" services. This tutorial will show you how to setup GitHub Actions on robot code projects."
