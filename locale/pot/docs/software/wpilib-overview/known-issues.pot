msgid "There is currently an issue with inter-operating C++/Java Network Tables clients (dashboards or co-processors) with LabVIEW servers (LV robot code). In some scenarios users will see updates from one client fail to be replicated across to other clients (e.g. data from a co-processor will not be properly replicated out to a dashboard). Data still continues to return correctly when accessed by code on the server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/wpilib-overview/known-issues.rst:53
msgid "**Workaround**: Write code on the server to mirror any keys you wish to see on other clients (e.g. dashboards) to a separate key. For example, if you have a key named ``targetX`` being published by a co-processor that you want to show up on a dashboard, you could write code on the robot to read the key and re-write it to a key like ``targetXDash``."
