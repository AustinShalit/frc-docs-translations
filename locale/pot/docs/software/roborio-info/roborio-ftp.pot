The top section of each pane shows you the hierarchy to the current directory you are browsing, the bottom pane shows contents of the directory. To transfer files, simply click and drag from one side to the other. To create directories on the roboRIO, right click and select \"Create Directory\"."

msgid "The roboRIO also has anonymous FTP enabled. It is recommended to use SFTP as described above, but depending on what you need FTP may work in a pinch with no additional software required. To FTP to the roboRIO, open a Windows Explorer window (on Windows 7, you can click Start->My Computer). In the address bar, type ftp://roboRIO-TEAM-frc.local and press enter. You can now browse the roboRIO file system just like you would browse files on your computer."
