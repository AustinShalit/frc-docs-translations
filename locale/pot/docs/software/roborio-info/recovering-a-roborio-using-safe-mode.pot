msgid "In Safe Mode, the roboRIO boots a separate copy of the operating system into a RAM Disk. This allows you to recover the roboRIO even if the normal copy of the OS is corrupted. While in Safe Mode, any changes made to the OS (such as changes made by accessing the device via SSH or Serial) will not persist to the normal copy of the OS stored on disk."
