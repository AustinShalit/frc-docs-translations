msgid "This is an example of a basic vision setup that posts the target's location in the aiming coordinate system described :ref:`here <docs/software/vision-processing/introduction/identifying-and-processing-the-targets:Measurements>` to NetworkTables, and uses CameraServer to display a bounding rectangle of the contour detected. This example will display the framerate of the processing code on the images sent to CameraServer."
