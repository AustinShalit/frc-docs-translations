msgid "Erosion in computer vision is similar to erosion on soil. It takes away from the borders of foreground objects. This process can remove noise from the background."

msgid "During erosion, if the superimposed kernel's pixels are not contained completely by the binary image's pixels, the pixel that it was superimposed on is deleted."

msgid "Dilation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/vision-processing/frcvision/morphological-operations.rst:43
msgid "Dilation is opposite of erosion. Instead of taking away from the borders, it adds to them. This process can remove small holes inside a larger region."
