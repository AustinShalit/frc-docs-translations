And with all these options, it is still extremely simple to use. To display some data on the dashboard, simply call one of the SmartDashboard methods with the data and its name and the value will automatically appear on the dashboard screen."

The second option is to copy the :code:`C:\\Users\\Developer\\wpilib\\tools` directory to :code:`C:\\Users\\Driver\\wpilib\\tools`. When using this second method it is recommended to make sure that the Dashboard under both the Driver and Developer accounts point to the same save file (see Locating the Save File) below."
