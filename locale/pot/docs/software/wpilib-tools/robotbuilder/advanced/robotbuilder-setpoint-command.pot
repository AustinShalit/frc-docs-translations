msgid "A common use case in robot programs is to drive an actuator to a particular angle or position that is measured using a potentiometer or encoder. This happens so often that there is a shortcut in RobotBuilder to do this task. It is called the Setpoint command and it's one of the choices on the palette or the right-click context menu that can be inserted under \"Commands\"."

msgid "Suppose in a robot there is a wrist joint with a potentiometer that measures the angle. First :doc:`create a PIDSubsystem <../writing-code/robotbuilder-writing-pidsubsystem-code>` that include the motor that moves the wrist joint and the potentiometer that measures the angle. The PIDSubsystem should have all the PID constants filled in and working properly."

msgid "It is important to set the **Tolerance** parameter. This controls how far off the current value can be from the setpoint and be considered on target. This is the criteria that the SetpointCommand uses to move onto the next command."

msgid "Whenever this command is scheduled, it will automatically drive the subsystem to the specified setpoint. When the setpoint is reached within the tolerance specified in the PIDSubsystem, the command ends and the next command starts. It is important to specify a tolerance in the PIDSubsystem or this command might never end because the tolerance is not achieved."
