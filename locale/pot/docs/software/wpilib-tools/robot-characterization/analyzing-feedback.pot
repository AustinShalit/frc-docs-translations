msgid "The feedback gain calculation assumes that there is no mechanical backlash, sensor noise, or phase lag in the sensor measurement.  While these are reasonable assumptions in many situations, none of them are strictly true in practice.  In particular, many \"smart motor controllers\" (such as the ``Talon SRX``, ``Talon FX``, and ``SparkMax``) have default settings that apply substantial :ref:`low-pass filtering <docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/introduction:Introduction to Filters>` to their encoder velocity measurements, which introduces a significant amount of phase lag.  This can cause the calculated gains for velocity loops to be unstable.  To rectify this, either decrease the amount of filtering through the controller's API, or reduce the magnitude of the PID gains - it has been found that shrinking gains by about a factor of 10 works well for most default filtering settings."

msgid "The calculated feedforward gains are *dimensioned quantities*. Unfortunately, not much attention is often paid to the units of PID gains in FRC controls, and so the various typical options for PID controller implementations differ in their unit conventions (which are often not made clear to the user)."

Note that some settings, such as post-encoder gearing, PPR, and the presence of a slave motor must still be manually specified (as the analyzer has no way of knowing these without user input), and that others may vary from the given defaults depending on user setup."

msgid "As a rule, smaller values for the ``Max Acceptable Error`` and larger values for the ``Max Acceptable Control Effort`` will result in larger gains - this will result in larger control efforts, which can grant better setpoint-tracking but may cause more violent behavior and greater wear on components."

msgid "Sometimes, with an exceptionally light mechanism/robot and/or exceptionally-noisy data, it is possible for the ``kA`` value to be exceedingly small (or even slightly negative).  In this case, the user should set ``kA`` to zero.  The computed feedback gains in this case may also be zero - this is because such a mechanism should not require feedback to accurately track the setpoint under the assumptions of LQR.  These assumptions may not be perfectly accurate, and users may need to add feedback regardless - in this case, the loop must be tuned manually."
