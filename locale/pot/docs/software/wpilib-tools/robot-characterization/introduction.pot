msgid "The characterization tools consist of a python application that runs on the user's PC and matching robot code that runs on the user's robot. The PC application will send control signals to the robot over network tables, while the robot sends data back to the application. The application then processes the data and determines characterization parameters for the user's robot mechanism, as well as producing diagnostic plots. Data can be saved (in JSON format) for future use, if desired."

In particular, we're interested in figuring out which motor *input* (i.e. voltage from the motor controller) is required to achieve our desired *outputs* (i.e. velocity and acceleration of the motor)."

msgid "``kS`` is the voltage needed to overcome the motor's static friction, or in other words to just barely get it moving; it turns out that this static friction (because it’s, well, static) has the same effect regardless of velocity or acceleration. That is, no matter what speed you’re going or how fast you're accelerating, some constant portion of the voltage you've applied to your motor (depending on the specific mechanism assembly) will be going towards overcoming the static friction in your gears, bearings, etc; this value is your kS.  Note the presence of the `signum function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function>`__, because friction force always opposes the direction-of-motion."

The relationship between speed and voltage (at constant acceleration) is almost entirely linear (with FRC components, anyway) because of how permanent-magnet DC motors work."

msgid "Once these coefficients have been determined (here accomplished by a `multiple linear regression <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression>`__), we can then take a given  desired velocity and acceleration for the motor and calculate the voltage that should be applied to achieve it.  This is very useful - not only for, say, following motion profiles, but also for making mechanisms more controllable in open-loop control, because your joystick inputs will more closely match the actual mechanism motion."
