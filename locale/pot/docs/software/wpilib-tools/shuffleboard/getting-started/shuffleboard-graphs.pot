msgid "With Shuffleboard you can graph numeric values over time. Graphs are very. useful to see how sensor or motor values are changing as your robot is operating. For example the sensor value can be graphed in a PID loop to see how it is responding during tuning."

msgid "For related values it is often desirable to show multiple values on the same graph. To do that, simply drag additional values from the NetworkTable source view (left side of the Shuffleboard window) and drop it onto the graph and that value will be added as shown below. You can continue to drag additional values onto the graph."
