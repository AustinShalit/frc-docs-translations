msgid "Shuffleboard is a dashboard for FRC based on newer technologies such as JavaFX that are available to Java programs. It is designed to be used for creating dashboards for C++ and Java programs. If you've used SmartDashboard in the past then you are already familiar with many of the features of Shuffleboard since they fundamentally work the same way. But Shuffleboard has many features that aren't in SmartDashboard. Here are some of the highlights:"

msgid "Shuffleboard supports **multiple sheets for the display of your data**. In fact you can create a new sheet (shown as a tab in the Shuffleboard window) and indicate if and which data should be autopopulated on it. By default there is a Test tab and a SmartDashboard tab that are autopopulated as data arrives. Other tabs might be for robot debugging vs. driving."

msgid "Graphical **display elements (widgets) are laid out on a grid** to keep the interface clean and easy to read. You can change the grid size to have more or less resolution in your layouts and visual cues are provided to help you change your layout using drag and drop. Or you can choose to turn off the grid lines although the grid layout is preserved."
