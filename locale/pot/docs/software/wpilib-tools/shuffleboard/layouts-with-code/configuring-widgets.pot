msgid "Widgets can be specified by name; however, names are case- and whitespace-sensitive (\"Number Slider\" is different from \"Number slider\" and \"NumberSlider\"). For this reason, it is recommended to use the built in widgets class to specify the widget instead of by raw name. However, a custom widget can only be specified by name or by creating a custom ``WidgetType`` for that widget."
