msgid "``withSize`` sets the number of columns wide and rows high the widget should be. For example, calling ``withSize(1, 1)`` makes the widget occupy a single cell in the grid. Note that some widgets have a minimum size that may be greater than the specified size, in which case the widget will use the smallest supported size."

msgid "``withPosition`` sets the row and column of the top-left corner of the widget. Rows and columns are both 0-indexed, so the topmost row is number 0 and the leftmost column is also number 0. If the position of any widget in a tab is specified, every widget should also have its position set to avoid overlapping widgets."

msgid "If there are many widgets in a tab with related data, it can be useful to place them into smaller subgroups instead of loose in the tab. Much like how the handle to a tab is retrieved with ``Shuffleboard.getTab``, a layout inside a tab (or even in another layout) can be retrieved with ``ShuffleboardTab.getLayout``."
