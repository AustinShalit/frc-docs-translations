msgid "Widgets allow us to control and visualize different types of data. This data could be integers and doubles or even Java Objects. In order to display these types of data using widgets, it is helpful to create a container class for them. It is not necessary to create your own Data Class if the widget will handle single fielded data types such as doubles, arrays, or strings."

msgid "In this example, we will create a custom data type for a 2D Point and its x and y coordinates. In order to create a custom data type class, it must extend the abstract class `ComplexData <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/shuffleboard/blob/master/api/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/shuffleboard/api/data/ComplexData.java>`_. Your custom data class must also implement the ``asMap()`` method that returns the represented data as a simple map as noted below with the ``@Override`` annotation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/wpilib-tools/shuffleboard/custom-widgets/creating-custom-data-types.rst:34
msgid "It is also good practise to override the default ``equals`` and ``hashcode`` methods to ensure that different objects are considered equivalent when their fields are the same. The ``asMap()`` method should return the data represented in a simple Map object as it will be mapped to the NetworkTable entry it corresponds to. In this case, we can represent the point as its X and Y coordinates and return a ``Map`` containing them."

msgid "Other methods can be added to retrieve or edit fields and instance variables, however, it is good practice to make these classes immutable to prevent changing the source data objects. Instead, you can make a new copy object instead of manipulating the existing object. For example, if we wanted to change the y coordinate of our point, we can define the following method:"
