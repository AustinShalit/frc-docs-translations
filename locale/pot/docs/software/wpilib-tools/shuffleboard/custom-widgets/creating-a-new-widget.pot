msgid "Widgets allow us to view, change, and interact with data published through different data sources. The CameraServer, NetworkTables, and Base plugins provide the widgets to control basic data types (including FRC-specific data types). However, custom widgets allow us to control our custom data types we made in the previous sections or Java Objects."

msgid "The basic ``Widget`` interface inherits from the ``Component`` and ``Sourced`` interfaces. ``Component`` is the most basic building block of components that be displayed in Shuffleboard. ``Sourced`` is an interface for things that can handle and interface with data sources to display or modify data. Widgets that don't support data bindings but simply have child nodes would not use the ``Sourced`` interface but simply the ``Component`` interface. Both are basic building blocks towards making widgets and allows us to modify and display data."

msgid "A good widget allows the end-user to customize the widget to suit their needs. An example could be to allow the user to control the range of the number slider, that is, its maximum and minimum or the orientation of the slider itself. The view of the widget or how it looks is defined using FXML. ``FXML`` is an XML based language that is useful for defining the static layout of the widget (Panes, Labels and Controls)."
