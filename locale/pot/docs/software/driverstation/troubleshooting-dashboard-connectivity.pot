msgid "If you have an indicator on your dashboard that you expect to be changing it may be fairly trivial to recognize if the Dashboard is connected. If not, there is a way to check without making any changes to your robot code. On the Variables tab of the Dashboard, the variables are shown with a black diamond when they are not synced with the robot. Once the Dashboard connects to the robot and these variables are synced, the diamond will disappear."
