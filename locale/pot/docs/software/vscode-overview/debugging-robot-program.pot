msgid "Inevitably, a program will not behave in the way we expect it to behave.  When this occurs, it becomes necessary to figure out why the program is doing what it is doing, so that we can make it do what we want it to do, instead.  Such an undesired program behavior is called a \"bug,\" and this process is called \"debugging.\""

msgid "For beginning users who need to debug their programs but do not know/have time to learn how to use a debugger, it is often possible to debug a program simply by printing the relevant program state to the console.  However, it is strongly recommended that students eventually learn to use a debugger."

msgid "A \"breakpoint\" is a line of code at which the debugger will stop the program execution so that the user can examine the program state.  This is extremely useful while debugging, as it allows the user to pause the program at specific points in problematic code to determine where exactly the program is deviating from the expected behavior."
