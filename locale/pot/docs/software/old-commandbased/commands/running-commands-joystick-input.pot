msgid "This documentation describes the use of the legacy command-based library. While this documentation has been preserved to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library <docs/software/commandbased/index:Command-Based Programming>`."

msgid "You can cause commands to run when joystick buttons are pressed, released, or continuously while the button is held down. This is extremely easy to do only requiring a few lines of code."

msgid "The command based template contains a class called OI, located in ``OI.java``, where **Operator Interface** behaviors are typically defined."

msgid "In this example there is a Joystick object connected as Joystick 0. Then 8 buttons are defined on that joystick to control various aspects of the robot. This is especially useful for testing although generating buttons on SmartDashboard is another alternative for testing commands."

msgstr ""

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/old-commandbased/commands/running-commands-joystick-input.rst:84
msgid "In this example most of the joystick buttons from the previous code fragment are associated with commands. When the associated button is pressed the command is run. This is an excellent way to create a teleop program that has buttons to do particular actions."

msgid "Additionally commands can be triggered by arbitrary conditions of your choosing by using the Trigger class instead of Button. Triggers (and Buttons) are usually polled every 20ms or whenever the scheduler is called."
