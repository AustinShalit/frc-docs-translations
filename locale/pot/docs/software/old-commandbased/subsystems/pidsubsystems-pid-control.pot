While this documentation has been preserved to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library <docs/software/commandbased/index:Command-Based Programming>`."

msgid "If a mechanism uses a sensor for feedback, then most often a PID controller will be used to control the motor speed or position. Examples of subsystems that might use PID control are: elevators with potentiometers to track the height, shooters with encoders to measure the speed, wrists with potentiometers to measure the joint angle, etc."

msgid "There is a PIDController class built into WPILib, but to simplify its use for command based programs there is a PIDSubsystem. A PIDSubsystem is a normal subsystem with the PIDController built in and exposes the required methods for operation."
