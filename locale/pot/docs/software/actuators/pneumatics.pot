msgid "The Pneumatics Control Module (PCM) is a CAN-based device that provides complete control over the compressor and up to 8 solenoids per module. The PCM is integrated into WPILib through a series of classes that make it simple to use. The closed loop control of the Compressor and Pressure switch is handled by the PCM hardware and the Solenoids are handled by the upgraded Solenoid class that now controls the solenoid channels on the PCM. An additional PCM module can be used where the modules corresponding solenoids are differentiated by the module number in the constructors of the Solenoid and Compressor classes."

msgid "The Pneumatics Control Module from CTR Electronics is responsible for regulating the robot's pressure using a pressure switch and a compressor and switching solenoids on and off. The PCM communicates with the roboRIO over CAN. For more information, see `FRC Control System Hardware Overview`"

msgid "In FRC, pressure is created using a pneumatic compressor and stored in pneumatic tanks. The compressor doesn't necessarily have to be on the robot, but must be powered by the robot's PCM(s). The \"Closed Loop\" mode on the Compressor is enabled by default, and it is *not* recommended that teams change this setting. When closed loop control is enabled the PCM will automatically turn the compressor on when the pressure switch is closed (below the pressure threshold) and turn it off when the pressure switch is open (~120PSI). When closed loop control is disabled the compressor will not be turned on. Using a Compressor, users can query the status of the compressor. The state (currently on or off), pressure switch state, and compressor current can all be queried from the Compressor object."

msgid "The Pneumatics Control Module from Cross the Road Electronics allows for integrated closed loop control of a compressor. Creating any instance of a Solenoid or Double Solenoid object will enable the Compressor control on the corresponding PCM. The Compressor object is only needed if you want the ability to turn off the compressor or query compressor status."

msgid "FRC teams use solenoids to preform a variety of tasks, from shifting gearboxes to operating robot mechanisms. A solenoid is a valve used to electronically switch a pressurized air line \"on\" or \"off\". For more information on solenoids, see `this wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid_valve>`__. Solenoids are controlled by a robot's Pneumatics Control Module, or PCM, which is in turn connected to the robot's roboRIO via CAN. The easiest way to see a solenoid's state is via the small red LED (which indicates if the valve is \"on\" or not), and solenoids can be manually actuated when un-powered with the small button adjacent to the LED."

msgid "Single acting solenoids apply or vent pressure from a single output port. They are typically used either when an external force will provide the return action of the cylinder (spring, gravity, separate mechanism) or in pairs to act as a double solenoid. A double solenoid switches air flow between two output ports (many also have a center position where neither output is vented or connected to the input). Double solenoid valves are commonly used when you wish to control both the extend and retract actions of a cylinder using air pressure. Double solenoid valves have two electrical inputs which connect back to two separate channels on the solenoid breakout."

msgid "Double solenoids are controlled by the DoubleSolenoid class in WPILib. These are constructed similarly to the single solenoid but there are now two port numbers to pass to the constructor, a forward channel (first) and a reverse channel (second). The state of the valve can then be set to kOff (neither output activated), kForward (forward channel enabled) or kReverse (reverse channel enabled). Additionally, the PCM CAN ID can be passed to the DoubleSolenoid if teams have a non-standard PCM CAN ID."
