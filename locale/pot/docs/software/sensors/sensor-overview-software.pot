msgid "In order to be effective, it is often vital for robots to be able to gather information about their surroundings.  Devices that provide feedback to the robot on the state of its environment are called \"sensors.\"  WPILib innately supports a large variety of sensors through classes included in the library.  This section will provide a guide to both using common sensor types through WPILib, as well as writing code for sensors without official support."
