msgid "In principle, precise measurements of acceleration can be double-integrated and used to track position (similarly to how the measurement of turn rate from a gyroscope can be integrated to determine heading) - however, in practice, accelerometers that are available within the legal FRC price range are not nearly accurate for this use.  However, accelerometers are still useful for a number of tasks in FRC."

msgid "As per their name, single-axis accelerometers measure acceleration along a single axis.  This axis is generally specified on the physical device, and mounting the device in the proper orientation so that the desired axis is measured is highly important.  Single-axis accelerometers generally output an analog voltage corresponding to the measured acceleration, and so connect to the roboRIO's :doc:`analog input <analog-inputs-hardware>` ports."

msgid "Peripheral multi-axis accelerometers may simply output multiple analog voltages (and thus connect to the :ref:`analog input ports <docs/hardware/sensors/analog-inputs-hardware:Connecting a sensor to multiple analog input ports>`, or (more commonly) they may communicate with one of the roboRIO's :doc:`serial buses <serial-buses>`."
