msgid "In order to be effective, it is often vital for robots to be able to gather information about their surroundings.  Devices that provide feedback to the robot on the state of its environment are called \"sensors.\"  There are a large variety of sensors available to FRC teams, for measuring everything from on-field positioning to robot orientation to motor/mechanism positioning.  Making use of sensors is an absolutely crucial skill for on-field success; while most FRC games do have tasks that can be accomplished by a \"blind\" robot, the best robots rely heavily on sensors to accomplish game tasks as quickly and reliably as possible."

msgid "Additionally, sensors can be extremely important for robot safety - many robot mechanisms are capable of breaking themselves if used incorrectly.  Sensors provide a safeguard against this, allowing robots to, for example, disable a motor if a mechanism is against a hard-stop."
