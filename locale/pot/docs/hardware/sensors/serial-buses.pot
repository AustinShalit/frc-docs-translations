msgid "Both the digital and analog inputs are highly limited in the amount of data that can be send over them.  Serial buses allow users to make use of far more-robust and higher-bandwidth communications protocols with sensors that collect large amounts of data, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) or 2D LIDAR sensors."
