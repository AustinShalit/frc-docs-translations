msgid "The first step to identifying roboRIO networking issues is to isolate if it is an application issue or a general network issue. To do this, click **Start -> type cmd -> press Enter** to open the command prompt. Type ``ping roboRIO-####-FRC.local`` where #### is your team number (with no leading zeroes) and press enter. If the ping succeeds, the issue is likely with the specific application, verify your team number configuration in the application, and check your firewall configuration."

msgid "If you are attempting to troubleshoot the USB connection, try pinging the roboRIO's IP address. As long as there is only one roboRIO connected to the PC, it should be configured as 172.22.11.2. If this ping fails, make sure you have the roboRIO connected and powered, and that you have installed the NI FRC Game Tools. The game tools installs the roboRIO drivers needed for the USB connection."

msgid "If you are troubleshooting an Ethernet connection, it may be helpful to first make sure that you can connect to the roboRIO using the USB connection. Using the USB connection, open the :ref:`roboRIO webdashboard <docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-web-dashboard:roboRIO Web Dashboard>` and verify that the roboRIO has an IP address on the ethernet interface. If you are tethering to the roboRIO directly this should be a self-assigned ``169.*.*.*`` address, if you are connected to the OM5P-AN radio, it should be an address of the form ``10.TE.AM.XX`` where TEAM is your four digit FRC team number. If the only IP address here is the USB address, verify the physical roboRIO ethernet connection."

msgid "If there is an IP address in the step above, try pinging this IP address using the command prompt as described above. If this works, you have an issue resolving the mDNS address on your PC. The two most common causes are not having an mDNS resolver installed on the system and a DNS server on the network that is trying to resolve the .local address using regular DNS."
