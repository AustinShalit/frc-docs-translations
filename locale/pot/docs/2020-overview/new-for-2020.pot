msgid "**Addressable LEDs** - The roboRIO FPGA has been enhanced to be able to control individually addressable LEDs (WS2812 or compatible protocol) from the roboRIO PWM ports (non-MXP). Teams can connect the signal line of these LEDs directly to the roboRIO PWM signal line and control them from APIs in all three languages. Depending on the length of the LED string and whether any servos are also being powered from the PWM ports, teams may be able to power the string directly from the PWM port or may need to use an external supply."

Teams can connect these devices to the DIO ports on the roboRIO and access the encoder data via APIs in all three languages."

msgid "**CAN Bus Internal Restructure** - The internal implementation of the CAN bus has changed to reduce the latency incurred by CAN bus calls from robot programs. Team programs, particularly those with many CAN calls, should see reduced and more consistent loop timing with the new implementation. No team action is needed to take advantage of this change, the changes are limited to internal implementation. Users may notice changes in how some tools like the CTRE Phoenix Tuner work as a consequence of the restructure."

The user-facing API has not changed, users will see this benefit without making any changes to their programs."

msgid "**Command Based Framework Rewrite** - A new version of the Command Based framework has been written from the ground up based on the years of experience with the previous framework. Both frameworks will be available as options in 2020 and have been split out as \"vendor libraries\" (though they are still included in the WPILib installer) in order to reduce the chances of mixing the two which will not work correctly."
