msgid "LabVIEW FRC, based on NI’s LabVIEW 2019, is the development environment for LabVIEW, one of the three officially supported languages for programming an FRC robot. LabVIEW is a graphical, dataflow-driven language. LabVIEW programs consist of a collection of icons, called VIs, wired together with wires which pass data between the VIs. The LabVIEW FRC installer is distributed on a DVD found in the Kickoff Kit of Parts and is also available for download (see installation instructions page linked below). Instructions for installing the FRC libraries (package also includes Driver Station and Utilities) can be found :ref:`here <docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/frc-game-tools:Installing the FRC Game Tools>`.
