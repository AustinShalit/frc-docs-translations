msgid "Make sure you don't modify any file that is in a ``diagrams`` folder, or ends in ``.drawio.svg`` in any program other than draw.io, otherwise you might risk breaking the metadata of the file, making it uneditable."

msgid "Draw.io (also known as `diagrams.net <https://app.diagrams.net/>`__) are supported when saved as ``svg`` files, with embedded XML metadata for the draw.io source file (normally stored as ``.drawio``). This allows these images to both act as source files for the diagrams that can be edited in the future, and be rendered as normal ``svg`` files."

msgid "There are a few methods to save a diagram with the embedded metadata, but using the export menu is preferred because it allows us to embed any images in the diagram, otherwise they might not render properly on the docs."

msgid "To export go to ``File - Export as - SVG...``. Make sure ``Include a copy of my diagram`` is enabled to embed the diagram metadata, and that ``Embed Images`` is enabled so image files in the diagram are embedded so they render in the docs. Additionally, mark the ``Transparent Background`` option to make sure the background is displayed correctly."
